This directory contains data and R codes used for the bulk-RNA-seq analysis part of the paper titled "Effects of 3D culturing 
conditions on the transcriptomic profile of stem-cell-derived neurons".

Data folder contains following files:
1) Mouse reads filtered non-normalized count matrix, "mouse_reads_filtered_rsem.genes.counts.matrix.txt"
2) Mouse reads filtered TPM (Transcripts Per Million) matrix, "mouse_reads_filtered_rsem.genes.tpm.matrix.txt"
3) Table of sample descriptions as well as condition names, "samples_described_detail_sample_info.xlsx"

R codes used for the analysis contain condition names given in the sample descriptions table in Data folder.
